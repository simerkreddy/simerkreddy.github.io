## Purpose

The purpose of the code is to perform anlaysis on Budweiser Beers and Breweries data. Beers data provides the different measures of the Beer, such as it's name, ABV(Alcohal By Volume), IBU(Internation Bitternes Unit), Beer Style and the Brewery it comes from. 

Breweries data on the other hand provides the name of the Brewery along with the City and State it is located in. 
Analysis is done to provide insights from Beers and Breweries data on following aspects:
Brewery and beer distribution by State.
Comparison of ABV and IBU by-	
State, and 
Beer Style â€“ IPA and Other Ales.

#Step 1: Import the source files
#The provided source file have commas in data values, so I used "|" as the delimiter.The files have headers so, mark header=TRUE
beers_raw <- read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE, sep = "|" )
breweries_raw <- read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE, sep = "|" )

#Answering the questions
#Question 1. How many breweries are present in each state
#Solution
#Plot beweries by State

# Question 2.Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.  (RMD only, this does not need to be included in the presentation or the deck.)
#Solution
#Step 1 Left join Beers data with Breweries data based on the column "Brewery_id" in Breweries data set and "Brew_ID" in Beer data set
